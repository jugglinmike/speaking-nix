You find yourself in an enclosed space, many directories inside the
'island/cave/'.

As you know, your current location is a directory on the file system. That
directory is within another directory, which is in another directory, and so
on.

Your next location must be derived from your current location. Each directory
that makes up your current location starts with a numeric digit.  If 'X' is the
sum of those digits, go to 'island/cave/X' and speak to the cave dweller you
find there.

I am a talking turtle, hello.

Your quest for the treasure begins at the "footpath" directory. Go there, and
proceed to walk right, straight, left, and right. Read the sign at that spot.

(The turtle walks away very slowly.)
