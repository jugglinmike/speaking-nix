title: The File System
layout: chapter.html

???

- Your terminal is always located "inside" some directory on the file system.
- Your current location influences how many commands are interpreted, so it's
  important to know where you are!
- In this section, we'll cover a few tools to learn our location and move
  around.

---

???

- The file system is defined by a hierarchy of "directories".
- A directory can contain any number of directories (known as
  "**sub-directories**").
- For the most part, each directory is itself contained within exactly one
  directory (know as the "**parent directory**").
- These concepts are likely familiar because they are also featured in many GUI
  applications like Windows Explorer and Apple's Finder.

---

```
/top-level/sub-directory/another directory!
```

???

- On Unix-like systems, the forward slash character (`/`) separates directory
  names.
- This means that the forward slash character cannot be used in a directory
  name, but everything else is fair game.
- So the example above describes a path where `top-level` is a directory that
  contains `sub-directory`. Inside `sub-directory` is a third directory named
  `and another!` (yes: the name includes the space character and the
  exclamation mark).

---

```terminal
vm$ 
```

???

- On the command line, though, it's not always clear where we are. 
- By the way: in this course, we'll use the dollar sign (`$`) to indicate a
  command prompt.
- This notation is commonly used in software documentation, but it is only
  convention; there is nothing special about the dollar sign.
- Importantly, you should *not* include it when you copy commands from the web
- In any case, there are a few essential tools for getting our bearings.

---

# `pwd`

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ 
```

???

- The `pwd` command writes the terminal's current directory to the screen.
- This is an acronym for "print working directory"
- This information is so important that many people customize their command
  prompt to include it. We'll discuss customization later.
- In this example, we are in the "**home directory**" of the user named
  "sally". The home directory is a location reserved for your user account (new
  terminal windows typically start here).

---

# `ls`

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ ls
my-amazing-subdirectory
my-normal-file.txt
vm$ 
```

???

- The `ls` utility lists the contents of a directory--this includes files and
  sub-directories
- Without any arguments, it shows the content of the current directory

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ ls my-amazing-subdirectory
oh-boy-another-directory
just-another-file.txt
vm$ 
```

???

When invoked with a path to another directory, `ls` will display the contents
of that directory.

---

# `cd`

```terminal
vm$ cd my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ 
```

???

- `cd` allows us to move around inside the directory structure
- `cd` stands for "change directory" and it accepts a path that is our
  destination
- In this example, we're moving to a subdirectory named
  `my-amazing-subdirectory`. The output of `pwd` changes to reflect this.
- Any guesses for what happens when we try to `cd` into a file?

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ ls
oh-boy-another-directory
just-another-file.txt
vm$ cd just-another-file.txt
cd: just-another-file.txt: Not a directory
vm$ cd this-directory-doesnt-exist
cd: this-directory-doesnt-exist: No such file or directory
vm$ 
```

???

Notice that we cannot move into a file or into a location that doesn't exist.

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ cd my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ 
```

???

...and as discussed earlier, the forward slash character (`/`) separates
directory names.

---

# Going `$HOME`

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ cd ~
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ cd ~/my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ 
```

???

The tilde character (`~`) is a shorthand for "my home directory." You don't
have to use it all by itself; it can be used as part of a path, too.

---

# Backing up

???

We've learned how to dive into a directory, but we're kind of stuck once we get
there. Fortunately, there is a consistent method for referencing "the parent
directory."

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory/oh-boy-another-directory
vm$ cd ..
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ 
```

???

Two period characters (`..`) signify "the directory above."

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ cd ../../sally
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ 
```

???

This works just like any other directory name, so it can be used anywhere you
can write a path.

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ cd ../..
vm$ pwd
/
vm$ cd ..
vm$ pwd
/
vm$ 
```

???

The hierarchy of files is sometimes referred to as a "tree" because of the way
directories and sub-directories tend to "branch out" from the center. Continuing
this metaphor, the top-most directory is commonly referred to as the **root
directory**. We can't move any higher in the file system than the root.

---

# Paths from the root? Absolutely!

???

- Up until now, all the paths we've used have been based on the current working
  directory.
- It's also possible to specify a path regardless of our current
  location.

---

:continued:

```terminal
vm$ pwd
/home/sally
vm$ cd /home
vm$ pwd
/home
vm$ cd /home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ pwd
/home/sally/my-amazing-subdirectory
vm$ 
```

???

A paths which begins with a forward slash character (`/`) is known as an
"**absolute path**". It describes the same location regardless of where we are
when we use it.

---

# `tree`

```terminal
vm$ tree
.
├── my-amazing-directory
│   └── just-another-file.txt
└── my-normal-file.txt

1 directory, 2 files
vm$ 
```

???

- `tree` is a powerful tool for visualizing files, directories, and their
  relationships.
- It uses a text-based "tree" diagram
- It is not included in all systems by default, so you may need to install it
  yourself

---

# Inspecting files

???

Directories are great for organization, but most of our work concerns files.
Lets take a look at some tools for learning about files and their contents.

---

# `cat`

```terminal
vm$ ls
oh-boy-another-directory
just-another-file.txt
vm$ cat just-another-file.txt
This is the first line of just-another-file.txt
This is the second line of the file!
The file only has three lines, and this is the last one!
vm$ 
```

???

- The `cat` utility has a lot of uses (its name is short for "concatenate"),
  but the simplest use is for displaying file contents.
- One problem here is that all the content gets "dumped" to the screen. This
  means `cat` isn't very useful for files with more than a few lines.

---

# `less`

```terminal
vm$ less a-longer-file.txt
This is the content of a-longer-file.txt, but only
just enough of it to fill the screen. You can use
the "up" and "down" arrow keys in the terminal to
scroll through the whole file. Press the `q` key
to quit.
```

???

The `less` utility provides a way to review the contents of a large file. It
has a lot of special controls, but the most important ones are:

- "Up" arrow key, "PageUp" key: scroll upwards
- "Down" arrow key, "PageDown" key: scroll downwards
- `h` key: help
- `q` key: exit

---

# `sort`

```terminal
vm$ cat just-another-file.txt
This is the first line of just-another-file.txt
This is the second line of the file!
The file only has three lines, and this is the last one!
vm$ sort just-another-file.txt
The file only has three lines, and this is the last one!
This is the first line of just-another-file.txt
This is the second line of the file!
vm$ 
```

???

As you might expect from the name, the `sort` utility sorts its input by line
and displays the result.

# In Review

- Paths
  - The forward slash character (`/`) is the path separator
  - Two periods (`..`) denote "the parent directory"
  - The "root" directory is the topmost directory on the file system; it's
    name is simply `/`
  - The tilde character (`~`) denotes "my home directory"
- Utilities
  - `pwd` - display the current directory ("**p**rint **w**orking
    **d**irectory")
  - `cd` - navigate to another directory ("**c**hange **d**irectory")
  - `ls` - **l**i**s**t contents
  - `cat` - display file contents ("con**cat**enate")
  - `less` - display file contents with controls
  - `sort` - re-order the lines of a file and display the results
